I recently completed my Master of Science in Automation and Robotics at TU Dortmund, where I focused on the intersection of machine learning and computer vision in robotics. This area fascinates me because of its potential to solve complex challenges, and I’ve deepened my expertise through hands-on, problem-based courses in these subjects. Along the way, I have come in contact with exciting new tools.

Before starting my master's studies, I obtained a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Mechatronics from the National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan. 

When I’m not writing code, I’m probably outside running or playing tennis. I am passionate about sport’s ability to drive social inclusion and I love meeting new people through sports.

I’m currently seeking full-time opportunities where I can apply my skills and contribute to advancing technology in robotics and related fields.
