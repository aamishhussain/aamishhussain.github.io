I am currently studying automation and robotics at TU Dortmund.
I am deeply interested in how machine learning and computer vision come together to achieve tasks in robotics. I am actively pursuing this interest by taking problem-based courses in these subjects. Along the way, I am learning exciting new tools.

Before starting my master's studies, I obtained a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Mechatronics from the National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan. 

When I’m not writing code, I’m probably outside running or playing tennis. I’ve become passionate about sport’s ability to drive social inclusion and I love meeting new people through sports

I am actively looking for internships and work-student roles.
