Although 3D printers could design models for prototyping such as designing and testing of structural elements it contained a problem; i.e. it could not print on non-flat surfaces. 

Relatively un-explored domain of 3D printing on a body part is the main challenge in this body of work, which is tackled using state of the art sensing technology.
