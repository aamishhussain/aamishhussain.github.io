5g tele-operation of cars is a robust approach to rescue autonomous cars which fail to navigate on their own or are stuck. 
In this project group we demonstrated effectiveness this approach by racing two cars on the same track. One of them was tele-operated over the 5G network and the other running autonomously. Our team implemented both approaches.
